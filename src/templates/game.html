The mission, should you accept it is to infiltrate the Evil Hacker organization called Evil Hackers.

They have been causing chaos in the world by hacking into systems and stealing information. We have been tracking them
for a while and we have finally found a way to infiltrate their organization.

They have an election system that they use to elect their leader. We have found a vulnerability in their system that we
can exploit to get in. The hacker group being the geniuses they are use a special cryptosystem to store and manipulate
their votes.

Unlike regular cryptosystems like AES this cryptosystem allows you to perform arithmetic operations on the encrypted
data. We call this a homomorphic cryptosystem.

The election system uses a blockchain to store the votes. And this network is ONLY accessible within the Evil Hacker's
network, as such you can not access it from the outside. While this is a problem, we have a solution. We have an inside
man who goes by the name 'hero'. She has setup an ethereum account for you. The private key is
was generated by using sha256 on 'hero'. The public key corresponding to that account can be calculated through the
endpoint /pubkey/{priv_key}.

Hero has also left a hint in the Evil Hacker's Website. She said that it's a typo.

The right hand hacker might have a private key that is a 2 step chain hash of his name. His name is John Doe.

We also know that the cryptosystem uses the same keypair for all the users in the system. This means that if you can get
the private key of any user, you can decrypt all the votes, if you have the encrypted text.

Here is a summary of the information you have:
1. The Evil Hackers use a cryptosystem that is homomorphic.
2. The Evil Hackers use a blockchain to store the votes.
3. Hero, our inside man has setup an ethereum account for you.
4. The private key for the account is the sha256 hash of 'hero'.
5. There is a hint in the Evil Hacker's website, and hero's endpoint.
6. The right hand man's name is John Doe.
7. His private key is a 2 step chain hash of his name.
8. The cryptosystem uses an insecure keypair by sharing the same keypair for all users.
