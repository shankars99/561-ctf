# Writeup for Cryptography/HackTheDAO

Author: Shankar Subramanian

## Description

This challenge is a cryptography based challenge that shows: <br>
1. No matter how complicated the encryption algorithm is, if the keys are shared, the system is vulnerable. <br>
2. Amount of information you leak by not using randomness to generate keys. <br>

## Challenge

Because homomorphic cryptosystems are cool. This challenge also shows why you need high entropy in your keys. <br>
